##WALKTHROUGH##

  > Step 1
    - Kill some log monster with the default sword and earn some money
    - Go to the village using the south door
    - Go to the shop and buy at least one bomb
    - Find and talk to the PNJ in the village area near the cave and blow off the door

    Note: You may buy more stuff at the PNJ. One bomb is the minimum that allow you to go to step 2.

  > Step 2
    - Go inside the cave you just open
    - Interact with the pokeball (by clicking with [e] on it)
    - Now that you have a new friend in your team exit the cave
    - Take the door on your right in order to go to the road area
    - Here you may destroy the grass in order to win some money and refill your life when needed.
    - Use your mew power by clicking on the water (interact with [e]) next to the PNJ that told you to do so.
    - Go across the new built bridge and go to the temple outside road

    Note: You may also kill the log monster on your way.

  > Step 3
    - Before stepping inside the temple, kill the log monster in front of it.
    - Go inside the temple and take the magic staff
    - Leave the temple and go across the bridge back.
    - Once you are back on the main road map, go north and take the brick bridge
    - You should be teleported in front of the castle
    
    
    Note: Killing the Log Monster is not mandatory but it is better to avoid him blocking the outisde of the temple 

  > Step 4
    - Now Kill the darklord
    - Once done, take the key by stepping on it and interact with the castle door (by clicking on [e])
    - Step inside the castle and talk to the King
    - Well done you finish our game !

    Notes: If you die during the whole quest, you will just be teleported to your home in a safe location. You will just have to walk again to your past location.
